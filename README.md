# CCIP Bootcamp Exercise 3: Testing Cross-Chain contracts using Chainlink Local

This exercise has a Foundry walkthrough in the corresponding [section](https://cll-devrel.gitbook.io/ccip-bootcamp/day-2/exercise-3-testing-cross-chain-contracts-using-chainlink-local) of the course's gitbook, so there's no need for me to add one 😁
